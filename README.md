## help.me
A blended web-app and chrome extension that boosts productivity.
This project is currently in BETA. I will be releasing the compatible Chrome extension that tracks your productivity, blocks certain websites to prevent distractions, and provide analytics for everyday web browsing. You can view the finished website interface here: https://sandeepnamburi.github.io/help.me/

## Inspiration
Inspired by researchers at Johns Hopkins university, the best way to stay focused is by managing time. However, in today's world, computers, smartphones, and tablets only increase the likelihood of accessing social media and other distracting websites. We wanted to create a solution that addresses this problem in a fun yet interactive way. Hence, **Help.me** was born. 

## What it does
**Help.me** is a native web-app and chrome extension that pairs together for the ultimate browsing experience. When a user decides that he wants to remain focused for a period of time or wants to improve study habits in the long-run, he/she can use **Help.me**. **Help.me** is engineered based on different scenarios. If a user has a homework that he/she needs to work on, they can use the _ Homework Task _ feature. The _ Homework Task _ feature allows 5 minute breaks every 30 minutes of productivity. During the 30 minutes of productivity, all social media websites are blocked. In the _ Meeting _ feature, all news article sources and social media are blocked with shorter break intervals. Like so, we have 4 other custom features to help tailor user experience when using **Help.me**.

## How I built it
**Help.me** is built through emerging yet light-weight technologies so it can be used in any location and any engine. The front-end consists of HTML and CSS. The backend is written in Node. Our Node server connects directly to the Chrome extension for seamless integration of blocked websites. 

## What's next for Help.me
We have a whole lot planned for the future of **Help.me**. **First**, as we graphically constructed our website for mobile and tablet as well as PC, we plan on adding mobile functionality by creating a physical application rather than a website. We want to be able to alert the user every time he/she goes on a social media site or goes to something that's irrelevant to a particular task. **Next**, we want to add analytics. We want for the user to be able to see what website he or she keeps going to. We can create a circular chart that illustrates how productive a user was a tailor feedback from university research studies. **Finally**, we want to create a messenger bot in par with this website and app. Students have a keen necessity to send text messages. A messenger bot would use soothing messages to get a user to go back to his/her initial task. We will plan on using some text machine-learning algorithms to find out exactly why a user is getting distracted and tailor tips to improve the user's performance.

## Additional Nodes
Keep in mind that the Chrome Extension is required for full functionality demonstrated in GIFs and presentation.

## How to use
Everything was coded with intentions of fully open-source software. Feel free to add to the functionality on the HTML elements and connect data with your own Chrome Extensions.
